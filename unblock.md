# unblock us yourself!
#### did your favorite unblocked game website just get blocked? Here's how to make an identical clone, no coding required!
### 0. Create a github account
click this cool [hyperlink](https://github.com/signup) to teleport to the github signup page. just put in your email and stuff, you know the drill. <br> <br> 
If you haven't done this yet, you might also need to know the following
- repository = folder with all that project's code <br>
- forking = copying and creating a new version of the repository that you can modify
### 1. fork a repository
some prerequisites are required, as not everything will work in the web.
- the repository must contain an `Index.HTML` file
![sorry if this doesnt load but that's on you man](https://github.com/Bored-Entertainment/.github/blob/main/2023_05_12_0l5_Kleki.png?raw=true) [//]: # (i forgot to rename the file before uploading and im on github web atm ðŸ˜­)
<br><br> OR <br><br>
- the repository must contain an `Index.MD` file that looks like this 
![see above](https://github.com/Bored-Entertainment/.github/blob/main/markdownMD.png?raw=true)

Click the **Fork** button in the top right of the page
![waga baba bobo](https://github.com/Bored-Entertainment/.github/blob/main/fork.png?raw=true)
then just click the big green button.

#### optional step
##### set the name to `**yourname**.github.io` for the domain to be ``**yourname**.github.io`` instead of `**yourname**.github.io/themesacomplex` (themesacomplex or whatever websiet you choose to fork) 

you've now copied all the files from the other repository

### 2. set up github pages
you've now gotten all your files in order, time to make your copy visible to the world wide web.
click the **Settings** button
![bored entertainment is an anti sbugnle zone](https://github.com/Bored-Entertainment/.github/blob/main/settings.png?raw=true)
click the **Pages** tab
![graggleland is not a safety hazard](https://github.com/Bored-Entertainment/.github/blob/main/main%20settings%20menus.png?raw=true)
Click **branches**, then click **main** (may vary)
![im out of ideas](https://github.com/Bored-Entertainment/.github/blob/main/branches%20then%20main.png?raw=true)
#### double check
##### make sure **Source** is set to **Deploy from a branch**, and NOT **Github Actions**. It is like this by default, but you never know when TurboGarbage strikes.
click **Save**.

You should see this banner at the top of your screen.

### 3. cool
go to the **actions** tab
![awampbambaloombam awampbamboo](https://github.com/Bored-Entertainment/.github/blob/main/actions.png?raw=true)
click on the action (or top action, if there are multiple) ((there should not be multiple)) 
![dont say slurs](https://github.com/Bored-Entertainment/.github/blob/main/acctions%20menu.png?raw=true)
and wait for your project to build :)

this can take annoyingly long sometimes. with mesa.rip, I think in total it's around 2 minutes, but with the mesa complex (OG) it can be upwards of 15.
#### protip
##### you can click on any of the nodes to see exactly what is happening right at that moment while the website is building. pretty cool

#### pro-er tip
##### the node tree and the actions tab do not automatically update when a thing is done (im pretty sure). reload and double check
if all goes according to plan, there will be a link shown on the deploy node that goes to your shiny new clone. way to go, boy!
